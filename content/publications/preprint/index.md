publication: "Taxing Carbon, Taxing Place? Spatial Disparities of Carbon Tax Impacts across 13 Million Canadian Households"

abstract: Canadian federal policy mandated a minimum price on greenhouse gas emissions. Provinces without a carbon price adopted the federal pricing program, consisting of revenue recycling with lump-sum rebates. The program’s overall progressivity has been previously demonstrated, but the complex interplay of location-specific and housing factors inhibits understanding of the program’s distributional impacts. I employ spatial microsimulation and machine learning techniques to estimate the impacts of a federal-style carbon tax on 13 million Canadian households living in over 3600 municipalities. I find that aggregate results conceal significant spatial inequalities across similar levels of income, and suggest that place-based policies can reduce heterogeneity of welfare effects, possibly increasing policy acceptability.
