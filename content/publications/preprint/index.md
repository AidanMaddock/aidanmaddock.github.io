publication: Taxing Carbon, Taxing Place? Spatial Disparities of Carbon Tax
  Impacts across 13 Million Canadian Households
publication_short: ""

abstract: Canadian federal policy mandated a minimum price on greenhouse gas
  emissions. Provinces without a carbon price adopted the federal pricing
  program, consisting of revenue recycling with lump-sum rebates. The program’s
  overall progressivity has been previously demonstrated, but the complex
  interplay of location-specific and housing factors inhibits understanding of
  the program’s distributional impacts. I employ spatial microsimulation and
  machine learning techniques to estimate the impacts of a federal-style carbon
  tax on 13 million Canadian households living in over 3600 municipalities. I
  find that aggregate results conceal significant spatial inequalities across
  similar levels of income, and suggest that place-based policies can reduce
  heterogeneity of welfare effects, possibly increasing policy acceptability.
